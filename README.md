## Installation
For Linux users :
```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Answer `yes` to `Do you wish the installer to initialize Miniconda3?`


To create the Snakemake environment used to launch Snakemake, run the following. The `conda create` command can appear to be stuck on `Solving environment`. While we are actually arguably [never going to solve the environment](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/), the command is probably not stuck. Just be patient.

```bash
exec bash
conda config --set auto_activate_base False
conda create --name smake -c bioconda -c conda-forge snakemake=5.4.5
```

Before running Snakemake, you have to initialize the environment
```bash
conda activate smake
```

## Run
To run the workflow locally simply run the following command in the Snakemake conda environment, where `$CORES` is the number of available cores.
```bash
snakemake --use-conda --cores=$CORES
```
